== DESCRIPTION:

Natural language method chaining for Time, Durations and the like.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Acts on singular and plural of the following methods: second, minute, hour, day, week.
* Months are variable and do not lend themselves to concrete mathmatics, so they are not implemented.
* The Duration class holds many treasures and enables us in many ways.
* Perform mathematical operations between numbers and durations, durations and durations, and durations and numbers, and the 'unit' will be respected as expected in the algebraic rules.
* Iterators are implemented on Duration objects, respecting the unit of time the duration was instantiated with, or using a customized iterator unit.
* Durations can be 'anchored' to a starting time for convenience in many usages.

== SYNOPSIS:

  1.day #=> A duration of 1 day
  7.days #=> A duration of 7 days
  1.week #=> A duration of 1 week
  1.week - 2.days #=> A duration of 5 days
  1.week.from(Now()) #=> The time of 1 week from this moment
  1.week.from(Today()) #=> The time of 1 week from the beginning of today
  3.minutes.ago.until(7.minutes.from(Now())) #=> duration 3 minutes ago to 7 minutes from now
  3.minutes.ago.until(7.minutes.from(Now())) - 2.minutes #=> duration 3 minutes ago to 5 minutes from now
  4.weeks.from(2.days.from(Now())).until(8.weeks.from(Yesterday())) #=> A duration, starting in 4 weeks and 2 days, and ending 8 weeks from yesterday
  1.week - 1.second #=> A duration of 6 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds
  4.weeks / 2 #=> A duration of 2 weeks
  4.weeks / 2.weeks #=> The integer 2
  8.weeks.each {|week| ...} #=> Runs code for each week contained in the duration (of 8 weeks)
  8.weeks.starting(Now()).each {|week| ...} #=> Runs code for each week in the duration, but each week is also anchored to a starting time, in sequence through the duration.
  1.week.each {|week| ...} #=> Automatically chooses week as its iterator
  7.days.each {|day| ...} #=> Automatically chooses day as its iterator
  1.week.each_day {|day| ...} #=> Forcing the week to iterate through days
  1.week.each(10.hours) {|ten_hour_segment| ...} #=> Using a custom iterator of 10 hours. There would be 17 of them, but notice that the last iteration will only be 8 hours.
  # ... and more!
